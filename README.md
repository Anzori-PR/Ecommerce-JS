# E-commerce Website Project

Welcome to my E-commerce Website project repository! This project aims to create a simple e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus of this project is to gain more knowledge in working with vanilla JavaScript while implementing an e-commerce design.


# Technologies Used

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    Firebase (for database)

# Project Status

The project is still in progress. While it's not yet fully functional, I've made significant progress, including setting up a database using Firebase. I've encountered challenges along the way but have gained valuable experience and knowledge through overcoming them.

# Design Principles

Though the project may not strictly adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, I've focused on maintaining a clean and organized codebase. As I continue to work on the project, I aim to improve the code structure and ensure better adherence to software design principles.
